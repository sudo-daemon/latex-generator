# ChatGPT + LaTex

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a web application that leverages the power of the Chat GPT API to allow users to input natural text, process it using Chat GPT into LaTex, and output the resulting LaTex code as a pdf. 

## Timeline

### Week 1: Planning and Research

During the first week, the team will focus on planning and research to gain a better understanding of the project requirements and identify any potential roadblocks.

- Day 1: Kickoff meeting to discuss project goals, timelines, and team member roles
- Day 2-3: Research on Chat GPT API, exploring its capabilities and limitations
- Day 4-5: Planning the app's architecture and user interface

### Week 2-3: Development

The following two weeks will be dedicated to the development of the web app.

- Day 1-5: Backend development, integrating Chat GPT API, and creating APIs
- Day 6-10: Frontend development, designing user interface, and integrating backend APIs

### Week 4-5: Testing and Deployment

The final two weeks will focus on testing, debugging, and deploying the app.

- Day 1-3: Testing the app and fixing any issues
- Day 4-5: Finalizing the user interface and user experience
- Day 6-7: Preparing the app for deployment
- Day 8-10: Deploying the app to a cloud-based platform like AWS or Heroku
